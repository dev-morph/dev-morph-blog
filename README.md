* **Clean-Code**: I am not perfect, though, I always strive to write clean code.  
  (You can check [morphlib](https://github.com/dev-morph/dev-morph-blog/tree/main/morph-lib/components) of this project to see how I design and manage React components for clean code.)  
  (or my blog post about [how I write clean code](https://marklee1117.tistory.com/176))  
  
* **Responsive Web Design**: My blog is designed to be responsive on both web and mobile platforms like a below picture.
